# Matmul Process and Threads

Matrix Multiplication Benchmarks

## Report

The report is available in the main directory as "report.pdf". The source code for the report is available in the "report" folder.

## Graphs for benchmarks

You can generate the graphs for the benchmarks that are in the report by typing

```
make graphs
```

This will generate the individual graphs for each matrix multiplication method, as well as a combined graph for the real time taken for all the methods.

More information is available in the `Makefile` and the report. The graphs are generated using python libraries in `main.py` and `plot.py`.
